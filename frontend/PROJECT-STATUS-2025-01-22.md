- Added trust signals, security badges, professional styling
- Focus on business loans only (removed restaurant/medical/construction)

### 2. **Backend Infrastructure**

- Grade system (A+ to D)
- Tier system (PLATINUM to BASIC)
- Marketplace visibility controls

### 4. **API Endpoints Working**
- `GET http://localhost:3000` - Health check
- `POST http://localhost:3000/api/leads` - Create new lead
- `GET http://localhost:3000/api/leads` - Get all leads (internal)
- `GET http://localhost:3000/api/marketplace/leads` - Get anonymized leads

### 5. **Lead Scoring Algorithm**

- Credit score (0-30 points)
- Annual revenue (0-20 points)
- Time in business (0-15 points)
- Documents uploaded (0-15 points)
- Urgency (0-5 points)

## 📝 NEXT STEPS (TODO)

### **Immediate (Testing Phase):**
1. ✅ Test lead submission with test form
2. ⏳ Verify leads appear in MongoDB Atlas
3. ⏳ Test the full lead generation form
4. ⏳ Test marketplace lead display

### **Deployment (Next Session):**
1. **Deploy Backend**:
   - Options: Vercel, Railway, or Render
   - Need to set environment variables
   - Update CORS for production URL

2. **Deploy Frontend**:
   - Options: Vercel or Netlify (free)
   - Update API URLs from localhost to production

3. **Configure Domain**:
   - Point fidenta.loan to frontend
   - Set up SSL certificates

4. **Add Stripe**:
   - Get Stripe API keys
   - Implement payment processing
   - Add credit system for marketplace

### **Enhancement Phase:**
1. Add email notifications (Nodemailer configured but not implemented)
2. Implement file upload for documents
3. Add broker authentication system
4. Create admin dashboard for lead management
5. Implement lead purchase flow
